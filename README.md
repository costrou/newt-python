# Python interface for NEWT NERSC API
A thin wrappen making the NEWT api pythonic.
For full documentation on the [API](https://newt.nersc.gov/api/).

As a heavy user of NERSC I wanted to be able to run jobs at nersc
without having to start an ssh session. NERSC has a RESTful API that
allows users many possibilities.
